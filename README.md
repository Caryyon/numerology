## Overview

### Life Path Number
Let's say your birthday is December 15, 1992. To calculate your Life Path Number, you will reduce each component of this date to a single digit:

The month, 12, is reduced to 1 + 2 = 3.

The date, 14, is reduced to 1 + 5 = 6.

The year, 1992, is reduced to 1 + 9 + 9 + 2. This equal 21. Then, 21 is reduced to 2 + 1 = 3.

Then, we add the reduced month, date, and year numbers (3 + 6 + 3) and arrive at 12. Finally, we add 1 + 2, and reach 3. If you were born on December 15, 1992, your Life Path Number is 3. It may seem daunting at first, but once you see it all written out this way, it becomes far less intimidating, no?

### Master Numbers 
As mentioned above, the only time you would not reduce the final number is if you attain 11 or 22

For instance, Sir Paul McCartney, perhaps England's most famous Gemini, was born on June 18, 1942. When this date is reduced (month = 6, day = 9, year = 7), the sum is 22. Rather than simplify this to a single digit (yielding 4), the number 22 reflects the Master Number — the higher-octane iteration of 4, revealing McCartney's strong "life mission."

### Destiny Numbers
You can also use numerology to derive the root number of names or words — this is where our ancient buddy Pythagoras lends a hand. According to his theories, certain letters have specific numerical values, which are as follows:

1 = A, J, S

2 = B, K, T

3 = C, L, U

4 = D, M, V

5 = E, N, W

6 = F, O, X

7 = G, P, Y

8 = H, Q, Z

9 = I, R

Using this technique, it’s easy to find the root number associated with names, which numerologists refer to as your Destiny Number. To find your Destiny Number, calculate the root number of your full name (first, middle, last) by reducing each name to a single digit, and adding up the total.

For example, my full name reveals my Destiny Number: ALIZA (1 + 3 + 9 + 8 + 1 = 22, which becomes 2 + 2 = 4) KELLY (2 + 5 + 3 + 3 + 7 = 20, which becomes 2 + 0 = 2) FARAGHER (6 + 1 + 9 + 1 + 7 + 8 + 5 + 9 = 46, which becomes 4 + 6 = 10, then finally, 1 + 0 = 1), resulting in a Destiny Number of 7 (because 4 + 2 + 1 = 7).

Whereas your Life Path reveals your greater purpose, your Destiny Number offers insight as to how you will express your greater goals. So, as a Life Path 8 person, my mission is to cultivate abundance, and I will express this through my Destiny Number 7: analysis, research, and critical observation.

### Interpretations

**Number 1 (10/1, 19/1)**

Just as Aries, the first sign of the zodiac, is about action and initiation, in numerology, 1 is linked to forward motion. 1 symbolizes a pioneering spirit, independent nature, and innate leadership capabilities. On a bad day, 1 can be a bit bossy or boastful, hiding any insecurities behind over-developed self-importance. 1 must remember that although it is first, it can very quickly become the loneliest number. Even the most autonomous 1s need the support of their friends, family, and lovers.

**Number 2 (11/2, 20/2)**

2 is linked to sensitivity, balance, and harmony. Within numerology, the 2 vibration assumes the role of the mediator, creating harmony by bringing together dissonant forces through compassion, empathy, and kindness. 2 is linked to psychic abilities and intuition, and if this number appears as a Life Path or Destiny Number, the individual will be astute to subtle energy shifts and emotional nuances. Because 2 is so sensitive, it is very conflict-averse, and can end up feeling under-appreciated or unacknowledged. 2 must avoid seeking external validation and, instead, realize that perfect equilibrium needed already exists within.

**Number 3 (12/3, 21/3)**

Communication is paramount for 3. Symbolically, 3 represents the output of two joined forces: It is the essence of creation. 3 is highly gifted at expression, seamlessly sharing innovative and pioneering concepts through art, writing, and oration. Your work inspires, motivates, and uplifts others, and 3 finds great joy making others smile. However, 3 is also known to be quite moody, and if 3 feels misunderstood, may withdraw entirely. The escapist tendencies of 3 are easily mitigated by practicing peaceful mindfulness: With such an active imagination, it’s important for 3 to find moments of quiet to reset, restore, and recharge.

**Number 4 (13/4, 22/4, 31/4)**

In numerology, 4 has an earthy-energy and is centered around fortifying its roots. 4 adamantly believes in the physical world and knows that investing in a solid infrastructure is necessary for building a lasting legacy. Practical, hardworking, and responsible, the vibration of the number 4 is focused on creating logical systems that can support scalable growth. There is a solidity to 4, however, that can quickly devolve into rigidity; 4 must remember that rules are meant to enhance, not inhibit. It’s easy for 4 to become stubborn, so 4 benefits from learning to loosen up and think outside-the-box. 4 will feel liberated and inspired by finding the bravery to take a few bold risks.

**Number 5 (14/5, 23/5, 32/5)**

Free-thinking, adventurous, and progressive, 5 is defined by freedom. 5 needs to experience the world by engaging its five senses: For 5, life lessons are acquired through spontaneous acts of bravery. Akin to Sagittarius energy within astrology, 5 is known for its playful, impulsive, and vivacious spirit. But on the other side of its signature joie de vivre, 5 can become restless and impatient. Since 5 is always seeking discovery, it has a difficult time accepting life’s day-to-day responsibilities — including professional and interpersonal commitments. 5 must remember that when it narrows its gaze, it will discover that the most rewarding exploration exists in its own backyard.

**Number 6 (15/6, 24/6, 33/6)**

6 is recognized for its nurturing, supportive, and empathic nature. A true healer, 6 has the ability to problem solve in both the emotional and physical realms, helping others through its straightforward, yet gentle, approach. 6 has a strong sense of responsibility, and cares deeply for its friends, family, and lovers. This number also can easily communicate with children and animals, displaying a soft tenderness and caretaker spirit. But not everything needs to be parented, and sometimes 6’s protective energy can become domineering and controlling. To avoid carrying the world on its shoulders, 6 must learn to build trust and understanding for others: Simply put, everyone must follow their own unique path.

**Number 7 (16/7, 25/7, 34/7)**

The detectives of numerology, 7 is known for its investigative abilities and analytical skills. Astrologically, the number 7 can be thought of as a blend of Virgo and Scorpio energy: 7 is extremely detail-oriented, but is driven by inner-wisdom as opposed to tangible realities. 7 has a keen eye, and its astute observations fuel a quick-witted, inventive spirit. Because it can quickly find the flaws in almost any system, 7 is a bit of a perfectionist. 7 will often assume fault, so it’s important for this number to counterbalance its inherent skepticism with an open mind. Not everything will be foolproof — but that’s what makes life fun.

**Number 8 (17/8, 26/8, 35/8)**

8 is all about abundance. Within numerology, this number is linked to material wealth and financial success. Ambitious and goal-oriented, 8 can effortlessly assume leadership positions through its natural magnetism. 8 applies big-picture thinking to broaden its scope, racing up the top of any ladder to reach extraordinary heights. But with great power comes great responsibility: 8 breeds workaholics, and on a bad day, can become excessively controlling and possessive. However, its negative qualities can be lessened by giving back to the community. By using is success to help others, 8 realizes that there is nothing more valuable than contributing to the greater good.

**Number 9 (18/9, 27/9, 36/9)**

As the final single digit within numerology, 9 connotes an old soul. 9 is no stranger life’s ups-and-downs of life — been there, done that. Accordingly, 9 can effortlessly synthesize large quantities of stimuli, psychically connecting the dots to form a cohesive whole. The mission for 9 is to reach its highest state of consciousness, and to help others also achieve this spiritual awareness. 9 isn’t afraid to transform, and its malleable spirit inspires others to explore their own ranges of motion. Since 9, in many ways, has transcended the physical plane, it must constantly remember to anchor itself. 9 must learn to balance the abstract with the tangible, ultimately finding its place at the intersection of fantasy and reality.

**Master Number 11 (11/2)**

Master Number 11 revs up the energy of Number 2; its purpose is to heal the self and others through its elevated psychic abilities. Often times, Master Number 11's intuitive gifts are a result of extreme life circumstances: Master Number 11 has no choice but to cultivate extrasensory talents. In numerology, Master Number 11 is connected to spiritual enlightenment, awareness, and philosophical balance.

**Master Number 22 (22/4)**

Master Number 22, often referred to as the Master Builder, expands on the vibrations of Number 4. Master Number 22 is inspired to create platforms in the physical realm that transcend immediate realities — by fusing the tangible and intangible, Master Number 22 cultivates a dynamic long-term legacy. Master Number 22's skills are usually a byproduct of early childhood instability that fuels innovative thought. Industrious, creative, and dependable, Master Number 22 is always on a mission to transform.
